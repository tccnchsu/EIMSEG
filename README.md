Eye Image Detection and Segmentation dataset(EIMDSD)


Introduction
This dataset has various scale, pose, illumination, skin color, and occlusion factors. This variability in our dataset can make the trained model more robust to natural environments.  The dataset can help the training tasks required for eye detection and eye region segmentation to promote research and development in the field of eye detection and eye region segmentation.
